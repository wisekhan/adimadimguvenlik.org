# adimadimguvenlik.org
Articles in my old **adimadimguvenlik.org** blog site, the most of them in Turkish. I dont have time to translate them all. But you can simply use google translate!
This was my old blog about step by step security\.

I decided to continue on this platform!

The idea was simple : I wanted to write articles about the cyber security describing the subject step by step, thinking as a reference for me and everyone!

You can find in this repository all articles that were in **adimadimguvenlik.org** which was mainly in Turkish\.
The new articles will be in English under [**stepbystepsecurity**](https://github.com/wisekhan/stepbystepsecurity) repo
